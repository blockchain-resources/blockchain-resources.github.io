# Layer-1 Scaling Solutions

In the decentralized ecosystem, a Layer-1 network refers to a blockchain, while a Layer-2 protocol is a third party integration that can be used in conjunction with a Layer-1 blockchain. Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, for example, are Layer-1 blockchains. Layer-1 scaling solutions augment the base layer of the blockchain protocol itself in order to afford scalability. A number of methodologies are currently in development and practice that improve the scalability of blockchain networks directly. [^1]

Hereâ€™s how it works: Layer-1 solutions change the rules of the protocol itself in order to increase transaction capacity and speed, while accommodating more users and data. Layer-1 scaling solutions can entail, for example, increasing the amount of data contained in each block, or accelerating the rate at which blocks are confirmed, so as to increase overall network throughput.
